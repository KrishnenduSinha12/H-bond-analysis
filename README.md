# This code gives gives a comparison table of hydrogen bond occupancy of similar systems (eg Apo and Ligand Bound proteins, proteins with different mutations).

# Installation:
  https://github.com/KrishnenduSinha12/H-bond-analysis.git
  
# How to use the code: 
   Python H-bond-analysis.py -dirs dirname
# Future outlook:
  Generating network plot based on the hydrogen bond occupancy difference
